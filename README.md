# boot2docker-vagrant
Vagrantfile with minor customizations for boot2docker on my OSX system with VirtualBox. Box is otherwise stock from `https://vagrantcloud.com/yungsang/boot2docker`.

To use, assuming Vagrant is already installed, and Virtualbox is too, just do:
```
vagrant init yungsang/boot2docker
```
